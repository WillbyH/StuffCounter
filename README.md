# Stuff Counter
Get a list of everything in your park with the amount.

### Put the StuffCounter.js file in your plugins folder.

This plugin will give you a list of all tracks, scenary, tiles, peeps, cars, and of course ducks in a list with the amount of that thing listed next to it. You may sort these by the amount or by the name of the thing.

You can also select a specific area of your park and view what is in that area. Click the deselect button to go back to the full park view.
*Selecting an area will disable peeps, cars, tiles and those good little ducks from showing.*
