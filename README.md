# Stuff Counter
Get a list of everything in your park with the amount.

### Put the StuffCounter.js file in your plugins folder.
*You could use AdvancedStuffCounter too, read below for more information*

This plugin will give you a list of all tracks, scenery, tiles, peeps, cars, and of course ducks in a list with the amount of that thing listed next to it. You may sort these by the amount or by the name of the thing.

You can also select a specific area of your park and view what is in that area. Click the deselect button to go back to the full park view.
*Selecting an area will disable peeps, cars, tiles and those good little ducks from showing.*

*Player Stuff does not include: guests, tiles, surfaces and ducks.*

### What is AdvancedStuffCounter.js?
Advanced Stuff Counter will also include the identifier, I do not recommend using this version of the plugin. That is unless you have a heap of custom scenery. I have heard it is helpful then.
